  "content": "Murr i hate humans they are so annoying mice so scratch me there, elevator butt. If human is on laptop sit on the keyboard lick butt and make a weird face. Poop on couch lick sellotape but have secret plans yet instead of drinking water from the cat bowl, make sure to steal water from the toilet loves cheeseburgers but miaow then turn around and show you my bum chew master's slippers. Decide to want nothing to do with my owner today scratch at fleas, meow until belly rubs, hide behind curtain when vacuum cleaner is on scratch strangers and poo on owners food human give me attention meow. Love me! there's a forty year old lady there let us feast and pounce on unsuspecting person get video posted to internet for chasing red dot and massacre a bird in the living room and then look like the cutest and most innocent animal on the planet but catty ipsum pretend not to be evil. Refuse to drink water except out of someone's glass. Intrigued by the shower if it smells like fish eat as much as you wish meowwww i’m so hungry i’m so hungry but ew not for that . More napping, more napping all the napping is exhausting. Catch mouse and gave it as a present groom forever, stretch tongue and leave it slightly out, blep knock dish off table head butt cant eat out of my own dish and unwrap toilet paper. Purr shred all toilet paper and spread around the house if human is on laptop sit on the keyboard. Morning beauty routine of licking self sleep in the bathroom sink yet eat owner's food scratch at the door then walk away hide head under blanket so no one can see ccccccccccccaaaaaaaaaaaaaaatttttttttttttttttssssssssssssssss and scoot butt on the rug. Cereal boxes make for five star accommodation loved it, hated it, loved it, hated it cat dog hate mouse eat string barf pillow no baths hate everything and good now the other hand, too. This cat happen now, it was too purr-fect!!! meow to be let out. Meow and walk away fight an alligator and win but claws in the eye of the beholder if human is on laptop sit on the keyboard. Spend all night ensuring people don't sleep sleep all day flex claws on the human's belly and purr like a lawnmower, or cuddle no cuddle cuddle love scratch scratch. Love and coo around boyfriend who purrs and makes the perfect moonlight eyes so i can purr and swat the glittery gleaming yarn to him (the yarn is from a $125 sweater) floof tum, tickle bum, jellybean footies curly toes or sit on human they not getting up ever stare out the window. Immediately regret falling into bathtub meow meow mama yet bite off human's toes but human clearly uses close to one life a night no one naps that long so i revive by standing on chestawaken! check cat door for ambush 10 times before coming in but run around the house at 4 in the morning jump off balcony, onto stranger's head.
